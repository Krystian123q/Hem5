# Hem5

This repository contains `Hem4V_Version12.py`, a helper script that clones a GitHub repository, installs its dependencies and attempts to run it.

## Downloading the script

If you only need the Python script, you can download it directly with `curl`:

```bash
curl -L -o Hem4V_Version12.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/Hem4V_Version12.py
```

Replace `<owner>/<repo>` with the actual GitHub repository path where this project is hosted.
